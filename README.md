##### Task 2: A/B Test Analysis â€“ Business Decision Making

Approach:
- Create multiple python functions, which:
-   (1) Creates a dynamic dataframe (using SQL) so that we can easily create data to test KPIs at day-n
-   (2) Chi2 Stat Test (Used for Retention Rate. A binary outcome and where we make no assumptions about the data distribution)
-   (3) Independent T-Test (Used for ARPU. Where revenue is a continuous variable (i.e. revenue can be an infinite number of values within a given range) 
-   (4) Visualise Retetention Rate data
-   (5) Visualise ARPU
