# ðŸŽ¯ FRVR: Senior Analyst Business Case

This github repo contains my work for case study presented to me by FRVR.

## Introduction

FRVR has presented me with a Business Case Study, in which FRVR has been testing a new rewarded ad model.

The case study aims to evaluate a Sr. Analysts ability to:
- analyze data efficiently
- derive actionable insights
- communicate findings to different stakeholders

The focus is on:
- cohort analysis
- retention trends
- AI-driven automation
- stakeholder alignment


## Tasks & How I've answered them


### 1: SQL Query â€“ Cohort Analysis & Retention Trends

- Everything presented in notebook including: SQL Query, Output Table, Additional Insights
- Notebook: [frvr_notebook_task_1.ipynb](https://github.com/maxbenjs/frvr/blob/main/frvr_notebook_task_1.ipynb)



### 2: A/B Test Analysis â€“ Business Decision Making

Approach: 
- Jupyter Notebook
- Create multiple python functions, which create dynamic datasets, runs statistical significance tests and visualises data / outcomes
- These functions are then run sequentially to get all relevant data in an output cell

Notebook: [frvr_notebook_task_2.ipynb](https://github.com/maxbenjs/frvr/blob/main/frvr_notebook_task_2.ipynb)




### 3 & 4: Executive-Level Data Visualization, Final Business Recommendation & Executive Summary

Approach:
I've combined the tasks into a single presentation. 
- The presentation can be found here: [frvr_presentation_task_3_4.pdf](https://github.com/maxbenjs/frvr/blob/main/frvr_presentation_task_3_4.pdf)
- The workings for the data & visulisations were done in the following notebook: [frvr_notebook_task_3_4.ipynb](https://github.com/maxbenjs/frvr/blob/main/frvr_notebook_task_3_4.ipynb)


Reasoning:
- Ideally the data would be visualised in dashboard in a BI Solution. Within a one-page executive summary we would link to the BI Solution
- I didn't set-up a BI solution due to time constraints
- The presentation starts of with the executive summary (task 4), before walking through the visualisations (task 3)
- The executive summary (task 4) is across 3 slides, which approximately corresponds to a single 1-page document
- The visualisations (task 3) don't mirror the cohesion of a dashboard. However, I've tried to achieve executive clarity in each slide / chart
